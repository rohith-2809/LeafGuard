🌿 LeafGuard
AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection, Diagnosis, and Intelligent Treatment Guidance
🔍 Overview

LeafGuard is a full-stack AI system built to detect plant diseases from leaf images, analyze the condition, and generate clear, actionable treatment recommendations.
It combines deep learning, MERN engineering, and Gemini-based reasoning into one unified, production-ready platform.

Designed for agritech startups, researchers, farmers, and developers building plant-health intelligence systems.

🧠 Deep Learning Model

LeafGuard includes a high-accuracy image classification model trained on 14,000 leaf samples across healthy and diseased classes.

Key characteristics:

ResNet50 backbone with two-phase fine-tuning

Balanced multiclass classification

Real-world robustness through heavy augmentations

High precision, recall, and overall consistency

Optimized for deployment and low-latency inference

This model forms the core detection engine of the system.

💻 MERN Full-Stack Platform

LeafGuard is not just a model; it is a complete functional system.
The MERN architecture ensures smooth user interaction, efficient data flow, and scalable deployment.

Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind):
User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images, viewing predictions, and reading health reports.

Backend (Node.js + Express):
Manages API routing, connects services, and handles all communication.

AI Microservice (Flask + Python):
Processes images, performs inference using the trained model, and passes results to the reasoning engine.

Database (MongoDB):
Stores user history, images, predictions, and system logs for extended analysis.

Together, they form a polished, end-to-end application.

🔬 Gemini AI Reasoning Engine

LeafGuard integrates Gemini Flash 1.5 to transform raw model predictions into meaningful agricultural insights.

Gemini generates:

Explanation of the detected disease

Recommended treatments

Organic and chemical cure options

Preventive measures

Long-term care instructions

This makes LeafGuard not just a classifier, but a complete digital plant-care assistant.

🌱 Intelligent Treatment & Cure Recommendations

After detecting the disease, LeafGuard provides:

Step-by-step treatment plans

Eco-friendly options for home gardeners

Advanced solutions for farm-level issues

Prevention strategies for long-term plant health

Actionable advice tailored to each disease category

This elevates the platform from detection to real agricultural decision support.

☁️ Model Deployment

The model is fully prepared for Hugging Face deployment, enabling:

Fast cloud inference

Integration with apps, dashboards, and mobile clients

Scalable processing for production workloads

LeafGuard’s architecture ensures flexibility across both research and commercial applications.

📌 Use Cases

Precision agriculture

Digital farming platforms

Nursery and greenhouse diagnostics

Educational and research tools

AI-powered plant-care mobile apps

Automated garden monitoring systems

LeafGuard is built to be reliable in both real farms and urban home-gardening settings.

🏁 Summary

LeafGuard unifies three powerful technologies:

Deep learning for accurate plant disease detection

MERN full-stack engineering for practical usage

Gemini AI for expert treatment recommendations

The result is a clean, intelligent, production-level plant health system suitable for real-world deployment.
